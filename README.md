# Tkinter-Student-Database
I created a Student Database GUI in my first year as project. In the GUI you can add student data in database (store it in a JSON File) and display its data, not just student data but you can also add course then see its data like student data and allocate courses  to students according to their rollnumbers. There are also validation function in the code in case someone add same rollnumber or try to save data without entering.

Initially I planned to make backend-frontend concept to create this project but then I just went crazy when I started coding added every thing in single python script but I tried to put proper comments and keep everything simple so if someone try to understand or see the code that person can understand. There is also a [pleasewaitscreen.py] and gif file ou can see in the files. That program is to create a loading screen when you run the program and then it opens our main Student database. This loading screen is not indented to be the part of the project but I still made it just for fun.
